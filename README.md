# Master's Degree Work in Python and R

During my master's studies, I extensively worked on various projects and modules utilising both Python and R programming languages. These files encapsulate my understanding of advanced concepts, research methodologies, data analysis, social networks and more. Below, you'll find an overview of the relevant modules: 

# Python modules:
- *Computer programming*: The fundamentals of computer programming where we design, write, and debug computer programs. Attched in the file is the final assigment of the module.

# R modules:
- *Data for data scientists*: The course covered the principles of digital methods for data collection, processing, and storage, workflow management for data transformation and cleaning, project-based learning with group collaboration, utilization of tools like git and GitHub, exploration of fundamental data types and storage, R markdown, data reshaping in R, handling common internet data types, web scraping, APIs, unstructured text data, exploratory data analysis with tools like ggplot2, relational and NoSQL databases using MySQL and MongoDB, and concludes with an introduction to cloud computing through platforms like Amazon Web Services. The attached files contains the final assignment submitted for this module.
  
- *Quantitative text analysis*: Surveys methods for systematically extracting quantitative information from political text for social scientific purposes, starting with classical content analysis and dictionary-based methods, to classification methods, and state-of-the-art scaling methods and topic models for estimating quantities from text using statistical techniques. The attched files are the fortnightly assignments.

- *Social Network analysis*: The course offered an overview of commonly used network analysis measures and concepts, drawing examples from the social sciences, and covers topics including node centrality, network closure, structural holes, structural equivalence, transitivity, degree assortativity, communities, balanced networks, small-world networks, scale-free networks, and hypothesis testing using exponential random graph models. The attched files are the fortnightly assignments.

All the corresponding files can be found within this repository, organised into folders based on the specific module.
